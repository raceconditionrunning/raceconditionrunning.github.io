*Bienvenue à la Nouvelle-Orléans et Endolyne Joe's!*

With marathon training in full swing, this week RCR ran the 20 miles from Golden
Gardens to the west side of West Seattle. The weather was excellent and the
views were almost amazing enough to make us forget that we were running for more
than three hours. Almost.

Most of the route was on familiar turf for us. Only a mile or so south of Alki
Beach, near the Vashon Ferry terminal, did we finally venture onto new terrain. It turns out there's a giant hill
there. Who knew?

Fortunately, after the giant hill there is [Endolyne Joe's][endolynejoes], a
restaurant which features a different region of the Americas every few months
with a special menu and extensive decor. When we went, they were paying tribute
to New Orleans. And let me tell you, it looked like the French Quarter blew up
inside the restaurant, in a good way. There were Mardi Gras beads and masks,
giant paper mache jazz instruments, and street signs from the Crescent City.

We started off with an order of beignets which, as is right and proper, were
served in a paper bag filled with way too much powdered sugar. The beignets also
came with a delicious blueberry compote. They were hot and delicious. About as
good as can be this far from Cafe du Monde.

The orders around the table varied. The Andouille sausage skillet with a Cajun
pepper hash was excellent. The forager's omlette was another favorite.

All in all, our trip to the Big Easy was an excellent way to recover from a
weekend long run. We hear that the restaurant will turn its attention to Puerto
Rico soon. We'll have to come back.


### Verdict

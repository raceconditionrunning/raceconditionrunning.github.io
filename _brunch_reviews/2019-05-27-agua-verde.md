Marathon training is in full swing, and we've started running on Mondays in
addition to our Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday runs. And this Monday was
Memorial Day, so we ran in the morning and got brunch afterwards.

The route wasn't anything we haven't done a million times before. We started
from CSE, ran up to Greenlake, then south to Fremont, and finished the loop on
the Burke. However, the weather was gorgeous, and good times were had by all.

Since we ended near the University, we went to a local favorite,
[Agua Verde][agua-verde-web], a combination Mexican restaurant and kayak rental
shop that sits right on the water overlooking Portage Bay. Since the weather was
so nice, we sat on the outdoor deck and got great views of the water and
Eastlake.

We ordered tacos (of the salmon, yam, and rockfish variety) and a burrito, as
well as fruity drinks of various kinds. We also got chips and guacamole and
tried the various salsas from the salsa bar. (The diablito is not actually hot;
it's a lie. The habanero, on the other hand, is.)

Agua Verde recently changed ownership, and the new owners have tweaked some of
the menu. For instance, the salmon tacos now come with kale. I thought the kale
craze had died down, but apparently in Seattle kale is like grunge and does not
go gently into that good night.

Overall, though, the food was good, and we will doubtless come back in the
future as we have many times in the past.

### Verdict

Food: 3 fish tacos 5  
View: 5 kayakers out of 5  
Wait time: Usually low  
Fruit-shaped table markers: On point  
Chill Factor: Sadly, they do require you to wear a shirt and shoes, but that's
              where the requirements end.
